This game project demonstrates explosion effect on unity with fancy little bit particle effect.
Essentially this was meant to be a mobile game project but i had no enough time for it due to classes and shit ton of life events that is happening here. 
Sadly game development careers doesn't pay enough for my life. And i had no power to support it further. If you are interested in this project, i made it open source so you can fork on it and work.
